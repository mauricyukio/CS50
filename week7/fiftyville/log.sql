-- So, Bruce is definitely our thief this time! However, before I proceed, I want to investigate why I was getting two people (Bruce and Taylor)
-- on the first time. I have a suspicion already that it may be because I was not being so precise with the time the car left the bakery, as I read this
-- "Sometime within ten minutes of the theft" as being imprecise and therefore unreliable information, and then concluding that
-- I should take it with a grain of salt. To double-check:
SELECT hour, minute FROM bakery_security_logs
    JOIN people ON bakery_security_logs.license_plate = people.license_plate
    WHERE year = 2021 AND month = 7 AND day = 28 AND activity = "exit" AND name = "Taylor";
-- +------+--------+
-- | hour | minute |
-- +------+--------+
-- | 10   | 35     |
-- +------+--------+
-- Indeed. As excpected, Taylor's time of exiting the bakery is just slightly out of the range of minutes I should have been considering since the beggining.
-- And I was definitely overthinking it all. Now that this is out of the way, let's move on to the rest of the problem, aka the accomplice

-- And it was Robin, who has no passport, all along! I should have known it!

-- To finish it off, and to practice a little more, I will find New York City again with a single query, for consistency sake:
SELECT city FROM airports
    JOIN flights ON airports.id = flights.destination_airport_id
    WHERE origin_airport_id = (SELECT id FROM airports WHERE city = "Fiftyville") AND year = 2021 AND month = 7 AND day = 29

-- And we're done! In case anyone ever reads this, I had a great time doing this exercise, I loved it, if you couldn't tell by the
-- sheer size of this thing. And most importantly, in combination with week7/movies, it forced me to really understand SQL queries.
-- I had never heard of SQL before and I finished this so confident and proud. Congratulations and many thanks, guys, for the amazing
-- educational experience CS50 is. I still can't believe this exists and is free. I'm so grateful I found it. Cheers!
