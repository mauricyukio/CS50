This python application is meant to help high-school students master quadratic equations.

It works like this:
    Randomly generates a quadratic equation and prompts user for an answer via form post;
    Verifies whether the user's answer is correct or not;
    In case it is wrong, it displays a button to show the correct answer, although the user has the option to retry and come up with it themselves as many times as they want;
    Alternatively, the user can input their own quotients for the calcutor to show the answer for a particular quadratic equation
